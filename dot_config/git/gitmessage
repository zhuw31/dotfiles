#
# [optional body]
#
# [optional footer(s)]
#
# Types:
#   build: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm)
#   ci: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: Travis, Circle, BrowserStack, SauceLabs)
#   docs: Documentation only changes
#   feat: A new feature
#   fix: A bug fix
#   perf: A code change that improves performance
#   refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
#   style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
#   test: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
#
# The commit contains the following structural elements, to communicate int
# ent to the consumers of your library:
#
# 1. fix: a commit of the type fix patches a bug in your codebase (this cor
#    relates with PATCH in Semantic Versioning).
# 2. feat: a commit of the type feat introduces a new feature to the codeba
#    se (this correlates with MINOR in Semantic Versioning).
# 3. BREAKING CHANGE: a commit that has a footer BREAKING CHANGE:, or appen
#    ds a ! after the type/scope, introduces a breaking API change (correla
#    ting with MAJOR in Semantic Versioning). A BREAKING CHANGE can be part
#    of commits of any type.
# 4. types other than fix: and feat: are allowed, for example @commitlint/c
#    onfig-conventional (based on the the Angular convention) recommends bu
#    ild:, chore:, ci:, docs:, style:, refactor:, perf:, test:, and others.
# 5. footers other than BREAKING CHANGE: <description> may be provided and 
#    follow a convention similar to git trailer format.
